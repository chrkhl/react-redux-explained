// redux store
// 1. holds the whole application state tree
// 2. only way to change state is to dispatch an action on it
//    -> actions only decribe what happened
// 3. state is changed only by reducers (reducing functions)
//    -> reducers describe how state is changed in response to actions
// 4. listeners can subscribe to state changes
